# Asha Jyothi Employable Skill Training Centre — Website

A responsive, production-quality single-page institutional website for **Asha Jyothi Employable Skill Training Centre**, a non-profit vocational institute operating since 2007 (16,800+ students trained) with official recognition by the Intermediate Board of Telangana.

This project is built using semantic **HTML5**, modern **CSS3**, and modular **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** with zero external runtime frameworks or build dependencies.

## 2. Technical Stack & Architecture

- **Semantic HTML5**: Native landmarks (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`), ARIA attributes (`aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `aria-live="polite"`, `role="dialog"`), accessible heading hierarchy, and JSON-LD `EducationalOrganization` schema.
- **CSS3 (Custom Properties & Responsive Layouts)**:
  - Custom variables in `:root` for brand navy (`#10194F`), brand red (`#D62828`), typography, spacing, and shadows.
  - CSS Grid and Flexbox for fluid layouts.
  - Respects `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` for users with motion sensitivity.
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**:
  - Single source of truth: 16 courses stored in `COURSES_DATA` array.
  - Dynamic card rendering with safe DOM APIs (`renderCourses()`).
  - Real-time search by keywords and filter pills by category.
  - Accessible modal dialog with focus trapping and `Escape` key support.
  - Interactive "Find the Right Course" advisor that pre-selects courses in the enquiry form.
  - Robust form validation (Indian 10-digit mobile number format, required fields, optional email format).
  - Clear submission service abstraction (`submitEnquiryService()`) that operates honestly in **Demonstration Mode** until a production endpoint is configured.

## 3. Local Execution Guide

The website is completely static and can be executed locally without any build steps or package installation.

### Option A: VS Code Live Server (Recommended)
1. Open the `asha-jyothi-website/` folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Install the **Live Server** extension (`ritwickdey.liveserver`) if not already installed.
3. Right-click on `index.html` and choose **"Open with Live Server"**.
4. The website will open at `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html`.

### Option B: Python Local Server
Run in PowerShell or terminal from the project root:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

### Option C: Node.js (npx serve or http-server)
```bash
npx serve .
```

### Option D: Direct Browser Opening
Double-click `index.html` to open directly in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).

### After editing courses: run the SEO build
`js/data.js` is the single source of truth for courses. Search engines and AI assistants don't reliably run JavaScript, so a small build step writes static copies of that data. After any change to `js/data.js`, run from the project root (Node 18+, no packages needed):

```bash
node tools/build.mjs
```

This regenerates:
- `courses/<id>.html`: one crawlable page per course (with Course, FAQ and breadcrumb structured data)
- the static course cards, course list JSON-LD and "Popular Courses" footer links in `index.html` (between `<!-- BUILD:... -->` markers; don't edit inside them by hand)
- `sitemap.xml`

Commit the generated files along with the `data.js` change.

## 4. How to Configure Confirmed Course Fees

By default, the institute states **"Courses starting from ₹750"** as the general pricing statement, while individual course fees default to `"Contact for Fees"` (`feeStatus: "contact"`).

To update an individual course with a confirmed fee:
1. Open [`js/script.js`](file:///C:/Users/bojja/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/asha-jyothi-website/js/script.js).
2. Locate the target course inside `COURSES_DATA`.
3. Set `feeStatus: "confirmed"` and specify the numeric `fee`.

**Example:**
```javascript
{
  id: "tailoring-basic",
  name: "Tailoring — Basic",
  // ... other fields ...
  fee: 1500,                    // Enter confirmed numeric fee
  feeStatus: "confirmed",       // Change from "contact" to "confirmed"
  image: "assets/images/tailoring-basic.svg"
}
```
The catalogue card and course details modal will automatically format this as `₹1,500` using Indian number formatting.

## 5. How to Connect the Enquiry Form to a Real Backend

The front-end enquiry form uses a clean service abstraction `submitEnquiryService()`. In default demonstration mode, it validates input on the client side and informs the user that demo mode is active with no live endpoint configured.

### Step 1: Choose Your Submission Service
- **Formspree**: Sign up at [formspree.io](https://formspree.io), create a form, and obtain your endpoint URL (e.g. `https://formspree.io/f/xyzabced`).
- **Web3Forms**: Obtain an access key at [web3forms.com](https://web3forms.com).
- **Custom REST API**: Your internal PHP / Node.js / Python server receiving POST JSON payloads.
- **Google Sheets / Apps Script**: A Web App URL connected to an admissions Google Sheet.

### Step 2: Configure `SUBMISSION_CONFIG` in `js/script.js`
Open [`js/script.js`](file:///C:/Users/bojja/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/asha-jyothi-website/js/script.js) and locate lines ~275:
```javascript
const SUBMISSION_CONFIG = {
  mode: "endpoint",                            // Switch from "demo" to "endpoint"
  endpointUrl: "https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID", // Your production endpoint
  timeoutMs: 8000
};
```

When `mode: "endpoint"` is set, submitting the form will send an HTTPS `POST` JSON request containing:
```json
{
  "fullName": "Student Name",
  "mobileNumber": "9876543210",
  "preferredCampus": "Secunderabad / Alwal",
  "courseId": "tailoring-basic",
  "courseName": "Tailoring — Basic",
  "email": "student@example.com",
  "message": "Interested in morning batch timings.",
  "timestamp": "2026-10-13T11:25:00.000Z"
}
```

## 6. How to Replace Placeholder SVGs with Actual Photographs

The current assets are SVG vector illustrations styled in Asha Jyothi's brand palette (`#10194F`, `#D62828`).

To replace them with actual institute photographs:
1. Save high-resolution, compressed `.webp` or `.jpg` photos into the corresponding `assets/` subdirectories:
   - Campuses: `assets/images/campus-secunderabad.webp`, `campus-medchal.webp`, etc.
   - Courses: `assets/images/tailoring-basic.webp`, etc.
   - Facilities: `assets/images/facility-classrooms.webp`, etc.
2. Update the image paths in:
   - [`index.html`](file:///C:/Users/bojja/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/asha-jyothi-website/index.html) for static section images.
   - [`js/script.js`](file:///C:/Users/bojja/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/asha-jyothi-website/js/script.js) inside the `COURSES_DATA` array for course images.
